SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Here are some of the most commonly used keywords and commands in SQL:

1. **SELECT:** Used to retrieve data from one or more tables.
2. **FROM:** Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data in a `SELECT` statement.
3. **WHERE:** Filters rows based on a specified condition in a `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
4. **INSERT INTO:** Adds new rows (records) to a table.
5. **UPDATE:** Modifies existing data in a table.
6. **DELETE FROM:** Removes rows from a table.
7. **CREATE TABLE:** Defines a new table's structure.
8. **ALTER TABLE:** Modifies an existing table's structure (e.g., adding columns).
9. **DROP TABLE:** Deletes an entire table and its data.
10. **PRIMARY KEY:** Specifies a unique identifier for each row in a table.
11. **FOREIGN KEY:** Establishes a link between two tables based on a column's values.
12. **INDEX:** Improves query performance by creating an index on one or more columns.
13. **GROUP BY:** Groups rows with similar values in specified columns for aggregate functions.
14. **HAVING:** Filters grouped rows in a `GROUP BY` query.
15. **ORDER BY:** Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.
16. **JOIN:** Combines data from multiple tables based on a related column.
17. **INNER JOIN:** Returns only matching rows from both tables.
18. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
19. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
20. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.
21. **UNION:** Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set.
22. **UNION ALL:** Similar to `UNION` but retains duplicate rows.
23. **DISTINCT:** Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
24. **AS:** Renames columns or tables with aliases.
25. **COUNT:** Calculates the number of rows or non-null values in a column.
26. **SUM:** Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
27. **AVG:** Calculates the average of values in a numeric column.
28. **MIN:** Retrieves the minimum value from a column.
29. **MAX:** Retrieves the maximum value from a column.

These are some of the essential keywords and commands in SQL. SQL also supports various other functions, operators, and clauses to
perform a wide range of operations on databases. The specific syntax and usage may vary slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) 
you are using, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
